        of struggle, prosperity, and life. Known as the City that Never Sleeps, this place is a beautiful area for
        exploration and touring the sites. Time and time again, people from all over the world come to see the true
        beauty of NYC; and the aim of this site is to show it to you as well. Here at Tourism@New York, we aim to show you the wonders of NYC and perhaps even its rich history. </h2>
